## Description

This is a simple code for validating passwords and storing it to a user object. It has functions where you can reverse the password, check whether the password and the input contains certain characters, and also a function to store user info.

## Challenges encountered

I found it difficult to do the part where we should validate whether the password has lowercase and uppercase characters and numeric characters.

## Solutions

I found a solution online where we can use the search function to check if the password contains the needed characters.
